## Background

Longshore spent two decades in operations leadership before teaching himself to code and transitioning into AI systems architecture. His military background (USMC) and Citadel education inform a bias toward structure, accountability, and shipping. At Intent Solutions, he applies that operator's mindset to organizational transformation — helping engineering teams navigate post-acquisition pivots and cultural restructuring, not just the tooling but the human systems underneath.

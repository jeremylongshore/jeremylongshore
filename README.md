## Creating Industries That Don't Exist

I sit where practical operations meets modern AI. I design, ship, and maintain production systems that eliminate manual busywork while keeping data private and compliant.

With **15+ years of corporate operational experience** at the managing partner level (Bloomin' Brands), I now build AI-powered businesses that deliver immediate ROI—not demos.

From Claude Code plugins to multi-agent intelligence platforms to AI SDR automation, I focus on tools that work. Helping fast-growing companies solve their most expensive automation challenges—from out-of-control costs and security compliance to workflow optimization. **All so you can focus on shipping your product.**

> *Every build is crafted in Gulf Shores, Alabama, and tuned to go live fast.*
